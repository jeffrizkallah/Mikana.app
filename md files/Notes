**EXTRA DETAILS FOR NOTES**

Feature Note: AI-Powered Recipe Import (LLM Parser)
This new feature introduces an AI-Powered Recipe Import to solve inconsistencies in our standard Excel templates. Instead of relying on rigid code that breaks when templates slightly shift (e.g., ingredients move rows), the system now uses a Large Language Model (LLM) service (like GPT-5.2). The LLM processes the raw Excel data, understands the context regardless of the layout, and reliably converts it into a clean, structured JSON format for direct database insertion. This drastically reduces the development time required for template exceptions and future-proofs our recipe intake process. (Check Gemini Chat)


Feature Note: AI-Powered Reheating Guidelines Import
The AI-Powered Import feature is extended to handle the "Reheating Guidelines & Quality Control Standards" file. This process uses the same LLM parsing strategy but is configured with a specific JSON schema tailored for branch operations (focusing on item_name, equipment, reheating_temp, reheating_time, and quality_standards). The LLM successfully interprets the visual matrix layout, including merged cells and section headers, to create a structured list of standards for the software, requiring no manual coding for layout changes.
